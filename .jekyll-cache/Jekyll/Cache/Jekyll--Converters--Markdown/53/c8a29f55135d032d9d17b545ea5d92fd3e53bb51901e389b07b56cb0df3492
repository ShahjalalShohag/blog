<h3 id="can-i-get-discounts-on-the-courses">Can I get discounts on the courses?</h3>
<p>If you are a school or college student, then <strong>you will get HUGE discounts</strong> (check the website). Otherwise, if you are an old academy member, then <strong>you can get up to 50% discounts on your next course by solving more problems in your current course!</strong> Check <a href="https://blog.shahjalalshohag.com/appreciation/">Academy Gold Pass</a> to learn more.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-have-promo-codes">Do you have Promo Codes?</h3>
<p>Yes. Because you deserve some discounts!</p>

<p>You can get promo codes from academy members and use them to <strong>get a 200 BDT discount</strong>! Note that the person who gives you the promo code will also receive 200 BDT!</p>

<p>Learn more about it here: <a href="https://blog.shahjalalshohag.com/promo-codes/">Promo Codes: How to Become a Billionaire!</a></p>

<h3 id="will-the-classes-be-live">Will the classes be live?</h3>
<p>Most of the courses are recordings of live classes. But here is what you will get</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extensive written resources on each class topic. Check this <a href="https://academy.shahjalalshohag.com/p/a-complete-guideline-to-competitive-programming-phase-1#course_details">demo</a> to understand what it looks like.</li>
  <li>Contests with curated hand-picked problems (20+ problems per contest on average).</li>
  <li>Editorials and Codes of the problems. Some of them have video editorials.</li>
  <li>Lifetime Discord server access to get help from me and other members who took this course.</li>
  <li>Video Recordings of the live class.</li>
  <li>Video Chapters for each video so that you can navigate the timestamps easily.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So the only difference between this and live class is you are watching a live class but you can‚Äôt ask questions directly in the class, but you can ask them on discord directly to me. I am waiting to reply to your questions.</strong></p>

<h3 id="can-i-join-anytime">Can I join anytime?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can join anytime even after years as the classes are not live and all contents have been pushed to the website.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-directly-talk-to-you">Can I directly talk to you?</h3>
<p>Yes, <strong>I sit with all academy members biweekly</strong> to understand how everyone is doing. Also, if you solve most of the problems from some course, then <strong>you can set 30 minutes 1:1 meeting with me!</strong> I would love to talk to you.</p>

<h3 id="why-am-i-giving-huge-discounts-for-school-and-college-students">Why am I giving huge discounts for school and college students?</h3>
<p>I mean these kids are only in school and college and trying to learn Programming at this early age! Isn‚Äôt it itself pretty cool? So, to motivate them more I made this easier for them. That‚Äôs it.</p>
