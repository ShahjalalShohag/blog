I"k<p>You are certain that this is the time.  This is the round that will be referred to as “yours.” You’ve worked really hard for this. For this very time. You couldn’t sleep the night before since your convoluted brain was continually tormenting you about the possible outcomes of your work. You are trembling with excitement as you examine the outcome. Yes, the same thing happened once again. You lost. You lost again. Your cerebrum began to taunt you again. You are thinking that people who worked lesser than you did better than you. You are thinking about the unfairness of life. Is life really unfair?</p>
