I"<p>Do you know what I have dreamt of last night?</p>

<p>I saw a dazzling star. I saw it coming towards me. It was so shiny, I bet it could have taken away the whole darkness from my blatant mind.</p>

<p>I saw a radiant sky. The moon was so slutty that it bestowed all its elegance upon the sea. I saw the sky mingling with the tranquil sea.</p>

<p>I saw Coldplay. I saw them playing ‘A Head Full of Dreams’ under a sky full of stars besides that celestial ocean. Oh dear, I felt all the chills in the world.</p>

<p>Then I saw YOU. I saw you approaching me. You ran all the way to hug me. You hugged me. We danced. We danced looking at each others eyes. We danced till I could dream.</p>

<p>Don’t you know? Don’t you know that it was all about you? Don’t you know that you are my dazzling star? My tranquility?</p>

<p>Don’t you know that you are my Coldplay? Don’t you? Don’t you?</p>

<p>Remember, how much I told you to take me somewhere nice, somewhere far from this mad world?</p>

<p>Take me, take me, take all of me.</p>
