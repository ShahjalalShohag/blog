<p>There is a great announcement! From now on, you can use promo codes and get a 200 BDT discount, and you can refer others to use your promo code and can get a reward of 200 BDT!</p>

<p>So basically</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you took any course, then you will get a promo code. And when someone uses your promo code to enroll in THAT course, then the guy will get a 200 BDT discount and you will also receive 200 BDT.</li>
  <li>If you are someone who is thinking of enrolling in a new course, then you can get a promo code from someone who already took THAT course.</li>
  <li>You can give promo codes to multiple people.</li>
  <li>Anyone can use at most one promo code for each course.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some quick maths:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you refer 1 guy, you will get 200 BDT.</li>
  <li>If you refer 10 people, then you will get 2000 BDT.</li>
  <li>If you refer 5 million people, then you will become a billionaire!</li>
</ul>
