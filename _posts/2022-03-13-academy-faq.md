### Can I get discounts on the courses?
If you are a school or college student, then **you will get HUGE discounts** (check the website). Otherwise, if you are an old academy member, then **you can get up to 50% discounts on your next course by solving more problems in your current course!**

### Do you have Promo Codes?
Yes. Because you deserve some discounts ^u^!

You can get promo codes from academy members and use them to **get a 200 BDT discount**! Note that the person who gives you the promo code will also receive 200 BDT!

Learn more about it here: [Promo Codes: How to Become a Billionaire!](https://blog.shahjalalshohag.com/promo-codes/)

### Will the classes be live?
Most of the courses are recordings of live classes. But here is what you will get
- Extensive written resources on each class topic. Check this [demo](https://academy.shahjalalshohag.com/p/a-complete-guideline-to-competitive-programming-phase-1#course_details) to understand what it looks like.
- Contests with curated hand-picked problems (20+ problems per contest on average).
- Editorials and Codes of the problems. Some of them have video editorials.
- Lifetime Discord server access to get help from me and other members who took this course.
- Video Recordings of the live class.
- Video Chapters for each video so that you can navigate the timestamps easily.

**So the only difference between this and live class is you are watching a live class but you can't ask questions directly in the class, but you can ask them on discord directly to me. I am waiting to reply to your questions ^w^.**

### Can I join anytime?
Yes, you can join anytime even after years as the classes are not live and all contents have been pushed to the website.

### Can I directly talk to you?
Yes, **I sit with all academy members biweekly** to understand how everyone is doing. Also, if you solve most of the problems from some course, then **you can set 30 minutes 1:1 meeting with me!** I would love to talk to you ^u^.

### Why am I giving huge discounts for school and college students?
I mean these kids are only in school and college and trying to learn Programming at this early age! Isn't it itself pretty cool? So, to motivate them more I made this easier for them. That's it.
