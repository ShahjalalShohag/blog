In case you don't know, I have an academy where I teach people how to be good at Competitive Programming. 

Academy Website: [https://academy.shahjalalshohag.com/](https://academy.shahjalalshohag.com/)

But there is a good news!

From now on, you will receive an appreciation from YouKn0wWho for being a dedicated and awesome programmer (if you really are). You will get the following incentives:
