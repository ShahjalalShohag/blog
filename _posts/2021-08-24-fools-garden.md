**The Fools Garden**

The air that I had felt <br>
The green that I had seen <br>
Reminded me of someone <br>
The fool that I have been

The fool who was alive <br>
Only at his garden <br>
Did he ever step beyond<br>
To find the lofty heaven

The nature and my friends<br>
The table and my door<br>
Humming me a single verse<br>
That I have to travel more
