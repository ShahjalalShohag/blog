In case you don't know, I have an academy where I teach people how to be good at Competitive Programming. 

Academy Website: [https://academy.shahjalalshohag.com/](https://academy.shahjalalshohag.com/)

But there is a good news!

### Academy Gold Pass
From now on, you will receive an appreciation from YouKn0wWho for being a dedicated and awesome programmer (if you really are). You will get the following incentives:
- **Get 20% discount in your next course.**
- 30 minutes of 1:1 video meeting with me.
- An appreciation letter and an official shoutout from my Facebook page.
- A grand treat from me if you can somehow meet up with me in real life!
- ~~Certificates (who cares about them lmao)~~

I would like to call this appreciation the Academy Gold Pass.

### Notes:
- You can receive appreciations for each phase! 
- Anyone can receive the rewards if they take the course anytime (live or not). 
- You should complete the criteria within the first 4 months of taking the course and demand your well deserved appreciation!
