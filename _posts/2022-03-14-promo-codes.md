There is a great announcement! From now on, you can use promo codes and get a 200 BDT discount, and you can refer others to use your promo code and can get a reward of 200 BDT!

So basically
- If you took any course, then you will get a promo code. And when someone uses your promo code to enroll in THAT course, then the guy will get a 200 BDT discount and you will also receive 200 BDT.
- If you are someone who is thinking of enrolling in a new course, then you can get a promo code from someone who already took THAT course.
- You can give promo codes to multiple people.
- Anyone can use at most one promo code to enroll in some course.

Some quick maths:
- If you refer 1 guy, you will get 200 BDT.
- If you refer 10 people, then you will get 2000 BDT.
- If you refer 5 million people, then you will become a billionaire!

On a serious note, just to be more transparent, normally courses give promo codes to hook more people into their courses. But in this current system that I am using right now, you guys are getting rewards.
