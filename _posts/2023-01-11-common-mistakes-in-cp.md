One thing is for sure. You do make mistakes. I also make miskates and that's what makes us human. But what we can surely do is â€” to try to minimize the errors that we make throughout our life.

I have compiled some of the mistakes that I made in my early Competitive Programming phase. I also mentioned how to avoid them. Also, in most cases, I will give you a chance to find out what the bug is before I reveal the culprit as I tried to make this blog interactive. The codes that I have used in this blog have been written in C++ as it is the most used language for CP.

So, if you are new to CP, stick with me as you might don't wanna repeat the mistakes that I made when I was a beginner.
